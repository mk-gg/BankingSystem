# BankingSystem
This is a simple banking system console application written in Java. It  was developed as a project for my second year college course in information technology. The application features basic authentication login, allowing users to securely access their account. Only authorized users, such as tellers or manager,  can perform operations such as opening new accounts for customers,  depositing and withdrawing funds, transferring funds, and updating  account details. Managers are able to view the active and dormant accounts. 

The application allows the creation of two types of accounts for customers: credit and savings. All the data are stored in text files.
